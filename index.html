You can then press Play to automatically generate next states or go through each step manually with the Step button. Each state is generated with one of the following rules:</p>
  <ol>
  <li> Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. </li>
  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li> </ol> <small>Adapted from Wikipedia- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Read more</a> there. </small></div>
